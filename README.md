# Calculator
I created a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to develop a functional calculator that can perform arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

----How To Use It-----
Here's a brief overview on how to use the calculator:

1. **Display**: The calculator screen initially shows `0`.

2. **Inputting Numbers**:
   - Click on any number button (0-9) to input digits. For example, clicking `7` followed by `8` will display `78`.

3. **Decimal Point**:
   - Click on the `.` button to add a decimal point. You can only add one decimal point per number.

4. **Operators**:
   - Click on an operator button (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to choose the operation you want to perform. For instance, after entering `5`, clicking `+`, and then entering `3`, the display will show `5 +`.

5. **Calculating**:
   - To get the result of the operation, click `=`. This will calculate and display the result. For example, after `5 + 3 =`, the display will show `8`.

6. **Clearing**:
   - Use the `AC` button to clear the calculator and reset it to `0`.

7. **Continuous Calculations**:
   - You can perform multiple operations sequentially. For example, `5 + 3 =` followed by `* 2 =` will display `16`.

8. **Handling Errors**:
   - If you perform operations in an invalid sequence (e.g., `5 + * 3`), the calculator will not calculate until a valid operation sequence is entered.

Remember, the calculator updates in real-time as you click buttons, reflecting each digit, operator, and result on the screen. This setup provides a simple and intuitive way for users to perform basic arithmetic operations.
